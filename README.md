# CHoRUSReports

This repo contains an R package to produce characterization reports to return to sites following their data submissions

It is based off of the [CDM Inspection Report](https://github.com/EHDEN/CdmInspection) created by Peter Rijnbeek 
for the European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project.

**NOTE** the queries and tables that they produce are only meant as placeholders and will be adapted to check 
various data quality elements and other data components.

More to come...
